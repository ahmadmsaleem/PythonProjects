My learning goals and objectives include gaining a deeper understanding of Python programming concepts, improving my problem-solving skills, and expanding my knowledge of various Python libraries and frameworks. Through this repository, I aim to showcase my progress and share my projects with others who may find them helpful or inspiring.
